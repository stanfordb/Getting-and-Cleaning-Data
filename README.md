Pulls data from UCI dataset (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) and applies "tidy data principles" (https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10) to the data. 

*Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
*Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
*Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
*Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
*From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. This dataset is found in the repo as output.txt
