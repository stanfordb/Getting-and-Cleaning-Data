## Data File Explaination
* activity_labels - text label of activities measured with associated ID. 
* features - text label label of each variables in X_test and X_train
* subject_test - ID of subjects in test data
* subject_train - ID of subjects in train data
* X_test - measurement values in test data
* X_train - measurement values in train data
* y_test - activity test data
* y_train - activity train data

## Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
*The activity name was brought into the dataset instead of just the activity ID.
*The new independent dataset with means per activity per subject had the column/variable names updated to reflect the mean calculation done on them.

## Appropriate Variable Labels 
*Variable names are verbose and not duplicated.

## Output indepenedent tidy dataset set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
*This dataset is generated by run_analysis.R as the output.txt file in the same directory as the R script.
